Project Objectives
NexaSphere Solutions has requested the development of a web-based dashboard application to offer their clients a customizable, user-friendly, and secure control center. The dashboard must allow users to:
1. Personalise their workspace by adding, removing, and rearranging widgets.

2. Access basic functionality as guests, while encouraging account creation for advanced features.

3. Switch between themes (light/dark/custom palettes) to tailor their experience.

4. Access real-time data (e.g., weather, quotes, finance) using free APIs.
